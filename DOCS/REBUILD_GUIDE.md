## Understanding the Project

Before starting the rebuild, review these documents to understand the project scope and objectives:

- [Documentation Index](DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md) - Overview of all documentation files
- [Implementation Plan](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) - High-level implementation strategy
- [Design Guidelines](DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md) - Visual design principles and patterns

## Project Architecture Overview

The GitHub Explorer application follows a modern architecture with Next.js for the frontend, Node.js for the server, and Supabase as the database. Review these files to understand the overall architecture:

- [Database Schema](DATABASE_SCHEMA.md) - Complete database structure
- [Next.js Architecture](NEXT_JS_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Frontend architecture
- [Node.js Server Architecture](NODE_SERVER_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Backend architecture
- [Supabase Integration](SUPABASE_INTEGRATION.md) - Database integration details

## Setting Up the Development Environment

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database)
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, React Context for local state
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts
- **Icons**: Lucide React

### Project Configuration

1. Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest github-explorer --typescript --tailwind --eslint
```

2. Set up Shadcn UI components
```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

3. Create Node.js server with Express
```bash
mkdir server
cd server
npm init -y
npm install express typescript ts-node @types/express @types/node
npx tsc --init
```

4. Configure environment variables
   - Create `.env.local` for Next.js frontend
   - Create `.env` for Node.js server

### Secret Management

Review the [Secrets](SECRETS.md) document to properly configure all required API keys and credentials.

## Database Integration

The application will connect to the existing Supabase database:

1. Set up Supabase client in both Next.js and Node.js applications
2. Configure database connection using service role keys for server operations
3. Implement data access patterns following the [Supabase Integration](SUPABASE_INTEGRATION.md) guide
4. Validate access to all existing tables outlined in the [Database Schema](DATABASE_SCHEMA.md)

## Node.js Server Implementation

Follow these steps to implement the Node.js server:

1. Set up Express application with TypeScript
2. Implement API routes for all required operations
3. Create data pipeline modules:
   - GitHub API integration
   - Data processing and enrichment
   - Database operations
4. Implement error handling and logging
5. Add authentication middleware
6. Create scheduled jobs for pipeline automation

## Next.js Frontend Implementation

Implement the Next.js frontend application:

1. Set up project structure using the App Router
2. Create layout components
3. Implement server components for data fetching
4. Design client components for interactivity
5. Set up authentication with Supabase Auth
6. Implement all pages and components defined in the architecture documentation

### Key Next.js Features to Leverage

- Server Components for data-heavy pages
- Client Components for interactive elements
- Server Actions for form submissions
- Route Handlers for API endpoints
- Middleware for authentication
- Image Optimization with next/image
- Font Optimization with next/font

## Page Implementations

### Homepage

Follow the [Homepage Architecture](HOMEPAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md) to implement the application homepage:

1. Create the `app/page.tsx` component
2. Implement all homepage components:
   - StatsOverview
   - TopContributors
   - DeveloperExcellence
   - TrendingRepos
   - HottestPRs

### Repository Page

Implement the repository page following the architecture described in the documentation:

1. Create the `app/repositories/[id]/page.tsx` component
2. Implement repository-specific components

### Contributors Page

Implement the contributors page following the architecture in the documentation:

1. Create the `app/contributors/page.tsx` and `app/contributors/[id]/page.tsx` components
2. Implement contributor-specific components

### Merge Requests Page

Implement the merge requests page following the architecture in the documentation:

1. Create the `app/merge-requests/page.tsx` component
2. Implement merge request-specific components

### Commits Page

Implement the commits page following the architecture in the documentation:

1. Create the `app/commits/page.tsx` component
2. Implement commit-specific components

### Admin Page

Implement the admin page for managing the data pipeline:

1. Create the `app/admin/page.tsx` component
2. Implement admin-specific components

## Authentication and Authorization

Implement authentication using Supabase Auth:

1. Set up Supabase Auth in Next.js
2. Create authentication middleware
3. Implement protected routes
4. Set up role-based access control

## State Management and Data Fetching

Implement state management and data fetching:

1. Use React Query for server state management
2. Implement custom hooks for data fetching
3. Create context providers for application state
4. Use Next.js server components for initial data loading

## Deployment

Set up deployment configuration:

1. Configure Node.js server for production
2. Set up Next.js deployment
3. Configure environment variables
4. Create deployment scripts

## Testing and Quality Assurance

Implement testing:

1. Set up unit testing with Jest
2. Implement component testing with Testing Library
3. Configure end-to-end testing with Playwright
4. Set up test automation in CI pipeline

## Implementation Sequence

Follow the implementation sequence described in [Epic Implementation Sequence](epics/EPIC_IMPLEMENTATION_SEQUENCE.md) to ensure proper dependency management during the rebuild process:

1. Phase 1: Foundation (Epic 1)
2. Phase 2: Core Pages (Epics 2 and 3)
3. Phase 3: Detailed Views (Epics 4 and 5)
4. Phase 4: Advanced Features and Refinement (Epics 6 and 7)

## Epic Implementation Details

For detailed implementation guidance for each epic, refer to these documents:

- [Epic 1: Foundation & Infrastructure](epics/EPIC_1_FOUNDATION.md)
- [Epic 2: Homepage Integration](epics/EPIC_2_HOMEPAGE.md)
- [Epic 3: Repository Page Integration](epics/EPIC_3_REPOSITORY.md)
- [Epic 4: Contributors Page Integration](epics/EPIC_4_CONTRIBUTORS.md)
- [Epic 5: Merge Requests Page Integration](epics/EPIC_5_MERGE_REQUESTS.md)
- [Epic 6: Commits Page Integration](epics/EPIC_6_COMMITS.md)
- [Epic 7: Performance & Refinement](epics/EPIC_7_PERFORMANCE.md)

## Conclusion

By following this rebuild guide and referencing the detailed documentation files, you can systematically reconstruct the GitHub Explorer application with Next.js, Node.js, and Supabase while maintaining compatibility with the existing database structure.

Remember to follow the implementation guidelines specified in [prompts/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md](prompts/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md) to ensure consistency and best practices throughout the rebuild process.
