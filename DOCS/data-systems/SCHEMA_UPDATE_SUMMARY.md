# Database Schema Update Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the major changes made to the GitHub Explorer database schema. The project has transitioned from using Supabase to SQLite as the primary database, and the schema has been updated to follow standardized principles.

## Key Changes

1. **SQLite Migration**
   - Moved from Supabase PostgreSQL to SQLite for improved local development
   - Updated connection code in `lib/database.js` to prioritize SQLite operations

2. **Table Renaming**
   - Renamed `github_raw_data` to `closed_merge_requests_raw` to better reflect its purpose
   - Updated all database functions to use the new table name consistently

3. **Schema Standardization**
   - Implemented dual reference approach for relationships (both UUID foreign keys and GitHub IDs)
   - Made all primary keys consistent using UUID format
   - Added `is_enriched` flag to all entity tables to track enrichment status

4. **Data Type Changes**
   - Changed `github_id` from TEXT to BIGINT for numeric GitHub identifiers
   - Made `username` nullable to handle unknown contributors
   - Standardized date/time fields to TIMESTAMP format

5. **Documentation Updates**
   - Created comprehensive `DATABASE_SCHEMA_AND_ACCESS_PATTERNS.md` as the single source of truth
   - Added SQLite-specific access patterns and best practices
   - Archived outdated documentation

## Implementation Files

The schema changes were implemented through the following SQL scripts:

1. `update_schema.sql` - Main schema update script that:
   - Created backup tables for each entity
   - Created new tables with updated schemas
   - Migrated data from old to new schema
   - Updated all references between entities
   - Added new indexing strategies

2. `cleanup_schema.sql` - Cleanup script that:
   - Removed leftover backup tables
   - Ensured all required indices were created
   - Applied SQLite optimization pragmas

## Access Pattern Updates

Database access patterns have been updated to:

1. Allow querying by both UUID foreign keys and GitHub IDs for better performance
2. Standardize error handling and return values
3. Provide SQLite-specific optimizations like proper connection management
4. Support batch operations and transactions for better performance

## Next Steps

For any code that still references the old table name or schema:

1. Update any remaining references to `github_raw_data` to use `closed_merge_requests_raw`
2. Update any Supabase-specific code to use SQLite if it's the primary use case
3. Review the database.js file for any remaining compatibility issues

These schema changes ensure that the GitHub Explorer application follows best practices for database design while maintaining compatibility with both SQLite and Supabase implementations where needed.
