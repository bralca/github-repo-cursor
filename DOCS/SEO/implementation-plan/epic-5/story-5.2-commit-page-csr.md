# Story 5.2: Commit Page CSR Components

**Description**: Implement client-side rendering components for the commit page, focusing on interactive elements and dynamic content.

## Tasks

### Task 5.2.1: Commit Content Client Component

**Prompt**: "Create a client component for the commit page in `github-explorer/components/client/CommitContent.tsx` that:
1. Receives commit, file, contributor, merge request, and repository data from the server component
2. Renders interactive elements like code diffs, comments, and related changes
3. Implements client-side navigation for related commits or files
4. Handles any client-side state management needs
5. Renders additional commit data that doesn't need to be server-rendered

Use the client component patterns established in Epic 1 and ensure a smooth user experience.

REMEMBER: 
- Use 'use client' directive and follow Next.js client component best practices
- Focus on interactivity and client-side performance
- Leverage existing UI components from the component library
- Follow patterns established for previous content client components
- Implement features incrementally, starting with the most important ones"

### Task 5.2.2: Commit Dynamic Data Fetching

**Prompt**: "Implement client-side data fetching for the commit page that:
1. Fetches additional commit data not included in the initial server render
2. Implements pagination or lazy loading for large file changes
3. Sets up related commit information if applicable
4. Handles loading and error states for asynchronous data
5. Optimizes for performance with techniques like request batching and caching

Use SWR or React Query patterns for client-side data fetching and state management.

REMEMBER: 
- Follow established data fetching patterns in the codebase
- Implement proper loading and error states for async operations
- Focus on user experience during data loading
- Keep implementation simple and avoid premature optimization
- Reference `DOCS/core-architecture/DATA_FETCHING_PATTERNS.md` for guidance"

### Task 5.2.3: Commit Interactive Elements

**Prompt**: "Implement interactive elements for the commit page that:
1. Creates a detailed code diff viewer with syntax highlighting
2. Implements line-by-line commenting functionality
3. Adds navigation controls for moving between file changes
4. Creates a responsive UI that works well on both desktop and mobile
5. Implements comparison views between different versions

Focus on enhancing the user experience with interactive elements while maintaining performance.

REMEMBER: 
- Create components that are both interactive and performant
- Use existing UI components and patterns when possible
- Implement accessibility best practices for all interactive elements
- Keep the implementation simple and focused on core functionality
- Reference `DOCS/core-architecture/COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md` for UI patterns"
