## Implementation Sequence

The implementation should follow the order of the epics and stories as listed above:

1. First, establish the core URL infrastructure (Epic 1)
2. Then implement individual pages starting with the Repository page (Epic 2)
3. Continue with Contributor, Merge Request, and Commit pages (Epics 3-5)
4. Finally, implement navigation and testing (Epic 6)
