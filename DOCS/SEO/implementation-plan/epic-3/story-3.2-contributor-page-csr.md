# Story 3.2: Contributor Page CSR Components

**Description**: Implement client-side rendering components for the contributor page, focusing on interactive elements and dynamic content.

## Tasks

### Task 3.2.1: Contributor Content Client Component

**Prompt**: "Create a client component for the contributor page in `github-explorer/components/client/ContributorContent.tsx` that:
1. Receives contributor data from the server component
2. Renders interactive elements like tabs, charts, and activity feeds
3. Implements client-side navigation for sub-sections of the contributor profile
4. Handles any client-side state management needs
5. Renders additional contributor data that doesn't need to be server-rendered

Use the client component patterns established in Epic 1 and ensure a smooth user experience.

REMEMBER: 
- Use 'use client' directive and follow Next.js client component best practices
- Focus on interactivity and client-side performance
- Leverage existing UI components from the component library
- Follow patterns established for the repository content client component
- Implement features incrementally, starting with the most important ones"

### Task 3.2.2: Contributor Dynamic Data Fetching

**Prompt**: "Implement client-side data fetching for the contributor page that:
1. Fetches additional contributor data not included in the initial server render
2. Implements pagination for contributor activity lists
3. Sets up real-time updates for contributor statistics if applicable
4. Handles loading and error states for asynchronous data
5. Optimizes for performance with techniques like request batching and caching

Use SWR or React Query patterns for client-side data fetching and state management.

REMEMBER: 
- Follow established data fetching patterns in the codebase
- Implement proper loading and error states for async operations
- Focus on user experience during data loading
- Keep implementation simple and avoid premature optimization
- Reference `DOCS/core-architecture/DATA_FETCHING_PATTERNS.md` for guidance"

### Task 3.2.3: Contributor Interactive Elements

**Prompt**: "Implement interactive elements for the contributor page that:
1. Creates tabbed navigation for different contributor views (repositories, activity, etc.)
2. Implements interactive charts or graphs for contribution statistics
3. Adds action buttons for user interactions (follow, message, etc.)
4. Creates a responsive activity feed or contribution timeline
5. Implements filter functionality for contributor activities

Focus on enhancing the user experience with interactive elements while maintaining performance.

REMEMBER: 
- Create components that are both interactive and performant
- Use existing UI components and patterns when possible
- Implement accessibility best practices for all interactive elements
- Keep the implementation simple and focused on core functionality
- Reference `DOCS/core-architecture/COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md` for UI patterns"
