# Story 4.2: Merge Request Page CSR Components

**Description**: Implement client-side rendering components for the merge request page, focusing on interactive elements and dynamic content.

## Tasks

### Task 4.2.1: Merge Request Content Client Component

**Prompt**: "Create a client component for the merge request page in `github-explorer/components/client/MergeRequestContent.tsx` that:
1. Receives merge request and repository data from the server component
2. Renders interactive elements like file diffs, comments, and approvals
3. Implements client-side navigation for sub-sections of the merge request
4. Handles any client-side state management needs
5. Renders additional merge request data that doesn't need to be server-rendered

Use the client component patterns established in Epic 1 and ensure a smooth user experience.

REMEMBER: 
- Use 'use client' directive and follow Next.js client component best practices
- Focus on interactivity and client-side performance
- Leverage existing UI components from the component library
- Follow patterns established for previous content client components
- Implement features incrementally, starting with the most important ones"

### Task 4.2.2: Merge Request Dynamic Data Fetching

**Prompt**: "Implement client-side data fetching for the merge request page that:
1. Fetches additional merge request data not included in the initial server render
2. Implements pagination for merge request comments and activity
3. Sets up real-time updates for merge request status if applicable
4. Handles loading and error states for asynchronous data
5. Optimizes for performance with techniques like request batching and caching

Use SWR or React Query patterns for client-side data fetching and state management.

REMEMBER: 
- Follow established data fetching patterns in the codebase
- Implement proper loading and error states for async operations
- Focus on user experience during data loading
- Keep implementation simple and avoid premature optimization
- Reference `DOCS/core-architecture/DATA_FETCHING_PATTERNS.md` for guidance"

### Task 4.2.3: Merge Request Interactive Elements

**Prompt**: "Implement interactive elements for the merge request page that:
1. Creates tabbed navigation for different merge request views (files, comments, commits)
2. Implements an interactive file diff viewer with syntax highlighting
3. Adds action buttons for user interactions (approve, comment, merge)
4. Creates a responsive comment and review system
5. Implements filter functionality for file changes

Focus on enhancing the user experience with interactive elements while maintaining performance.

REMEMBER: 
- Create components that are both interactive and performant
- Use existing UI components and patterns when possible
- Implement accessibility best practices for all interactive elements
- Keep the implementation simple and focused on core functionality
- Reference `DOCS/core-architecture/COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md` for UI patterns"
