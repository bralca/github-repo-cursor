2. Configure Next.js data caching for frontend API requests
3. Optimize image delivery and caching settings
4. Implement custom caching middleware and utilities
5. Set up proper cache invalidation mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria

- Homepage and contributor pages load data within 100ms
- Overall server load reduced by 50%+
- Image optimization costs reduced by implementing Vercel best practices
- Cache invalidation mechanisms in place for data modifications
- Caching strategy documented for future maintenance

## Stories
