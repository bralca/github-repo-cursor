## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

### Epic 1: Foundation & Infrastructure

1. Story 1.1: Database Schema Enhancements
   - This is the most foundational task as all other work depends on proper database structure
   
2. Story 1.5: GitHub API Integration Expansion
   - This should be done early as many features depend on GitHub data
   
3. Story 1.2: Data Pipeline Optimization
   - Optimize the pipeline that will process the data we collect
   
4. Story 1.3: Supabase Core Query Hooks
   - Create the foundation for all frontend data fetching
   
5. Story 1.4: Data Transformation Utilities
   - Build utilities needed across all components

## Phase 2: Core Pages (Weeks 3-4)

### Epic 2: Homepage Integration

1. Story 2.1: Stats Overview Integration
   - Start with the simplest component that shows aggregated stats
   
2. Story 2.2: Top Contributors Integration
   - Implement contributor metrics and display
   
3. Story 2.5: Hottest PRs Integration
   - Add PR overview integration
   
4. Story 2.4: Trending Repositories Integration
   - Implement repository trends
   
5. Story 2.3: Developer Excellence Awards Integration
   - Complete the homepage with excellence awards (requires more data to be useful)

   - Show repository-specific contributor information
   
3. Story 3.2: Repository Health Metrics
   - Implement health score calculations
   
4. Story 3.4: Contribution Heatmap Integration
   - Add visual contribution patterns
   
5. Story 3.3: Repository Timeline Integration
   - Implement detailed timeline visualization

## Phase 3: Detailed Views (Weeks 5-6)

### Epic 4: Contributors Page Integration

1. Story 4.1: Contributor Profile Integration
   - Core contributor profile information
   
2. Story 4.2: Contribution Metrics Integration
   - Add detailed metrics calculations
   
3. Story 4.4: Repository Contribution Integration
   - Link contributors to their repositories
   
4. Story 4.3: Contribution History Integration
   - Add historical contribution visualization
   
5. Story 4.5: Activity Feed Integration
   - Implement real-time activity tracking

### Epic 5: Merge Requests Page Integration

1. Story 5.1: PR List View Integration
   - Basic PR listing functionality
   
2. Story 5.2: PR Details View Integration
   - Detailed PR information display
   
3. Story 5.5: PR Metrics and Analytics Integration
   - Add PR-specific metrics calculations
   
4. Story 5.3: PR Review Information Integration
   - Include reviewer details and status
   
5. Story 5.4: PR Comments Integration
   - Add PR comments display
   
6. Story 5.6: PR Timeline Integration
   - Implement PR-specific timeline

## Phase 4: Advanced Features and Refinement (Weeks 7-8)

### Epic 6: Commits Page Integration

1. Story 6.1: Commit Details Integration
   - Core commit information display
   
2. Story 6.2: Commit Diff Visualization
   - Enhance diff visualization with context
   
3. Story 6.4: Commit in Repository Context
   - Add repository context to commits
   
4. Story 6.3: Commit Analysis Integration
   - Implement AI-powered commit analysis
   
5. Story 6.5: Author Impact Analysis
   - Add author-specific impact metrics

### Epic 7: Performance & Refinement

1. Story 7.1: Query Optimization
   - Optimize database queries across all pages
   
2. Story 7.3: Error Handling Enhancement
   - Improve error handling and recovery
   
3. Story 7.2: Caching Implementation
   - Add caching for improved performance
   
4. Story 7.4: Loading State Refinement
   - Enhance loading states and transitions
   
5. Story 7.6: Performance Monitoring
   - Add monitoring and alerting
   
6. Story 7.5: User Experience Refinement
   - Final refinements based on real usage

## Parallel Work Opportunities

While the sequence above represents the ideal logical order, some stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members:

1. UI Component Development (Frontend)
   - Loading states and UI shells can be built in parallel with data integration
   
2. Database Schema and Backend (Backend)
   - Schema enhancements can proceed while frontend components are being built
   
3. Data Collection and Pipeline (Data Engineering)
   - GitHub API integration and data pipeline work can progress independently

## Risk Mitigation

Key risks to monitor during implementation:

1. **Data Volume**: Large repositories may cause performance issues
   - Mitigation: Implement pagination and lazy loading early
   
2. **GitHub API Limits**: Rate limits may affect data collection
   - Mitigation: Add rate limiting and backoff strategy in the pipeline
   
3. **Complex Calculations**: Metrics may be expensive to compute
   - Mitigation: Use materialized views and caching for complex calculations
   
4. **Integration Complexity**: Many moving parts need to work together
   - Mitigation: Use clear interfaces and strong typing between components

By following this implementation sequence, we can ensure that dependencies are respected while allowing for parallel work where possible.
