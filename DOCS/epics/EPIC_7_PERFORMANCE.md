# Epic 7: Performance & Refinement

This epic focuses on optimizing application performance, implementing caching strategies, enhancing error handling, improving loading states, and refining the user experience based on real usage patterns.

## Current State

The application has implemented core functionality across multiple pages:
- Homepage with statistics and trending repositories
- Repository details page with timeline and contributors
- Contributors page with contribution summaries and activity
- Merge Requests page with PR lists and filters
- Commits page with diff visualization and analysis

However, several performance issues and user experience gaps need addressing:
- Database queries are not optimized for large datasets
- No caching mechanisms are in place
- Error handling is minimal and doesn't provide recovery options
- Loading states are basic and don't reflect content structure
- UX refinements are needed based on actual usage patterns
- No performance monitoring or alerting is implemented

## Goals

- Optimize database queries for better performance with large datasets
- Implement comprehensive caching with proper invalidation
- Enhance error handling with recovery mechanisms and user feedback
- Improve loading states and transitions for better perceived performance
- Refine user experience based on real usage patterns
- Implement performance monitoring and alerting
