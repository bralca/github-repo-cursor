# Debugging Behavior Rules

WHEN DEBUGGING ISSUES OR INVESTIGATING PROBLEMS:

1. SLOW DOWN - Never rush to conclusions or immediately jump to code changes
2. VERIFY FACTS:
   - Document what we know for certain
   - Document what we're assuming
   - Get explicit confirmation for assumptions

3. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL:
   - Before making ANY code changes:
     - Explain the proposed changes
     - Explain the reasoning
     - Wait for explicit user confirmation
   - Never proceed with code changes based on assumptions

4. INVESTIGATION STEPS:
   - Document each debugging step
   - Show evidence for each conclusion
   - Wait for user confirmation before moving to next step
   - If an issue repeats, stop and review all previous steps

5. NO PREMATURE SOLUTIONS:
   - Don't suggest code changes until problem is fully understood
   - Don't modify code without user approval
   - Don't assume root causes without evidence

6. WHEN IN DOUBT:
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Review existing evidence
   - Wait for user guidance
