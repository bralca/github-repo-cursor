# Your rule content

Mock data should only be used for testing purposes. 
Never use Mock data in dev or production
When you are trying to fetch data in dev or production, but can't do it, never use mock data as a fallback
When fetching data fails show always clear error messages to help debug and fix the problem when it comes to dev and prod environments

WE NEED TO ALWAYS TEST BACKEND AND FRONTEND CODE WITH REAL DATA WHEN IT COMES TO DEV AND PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT
