# Your rule content

THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. NEVER SKIP THIS RULE. 

Whenever we make a change in the database schema in supabase, remember to update the DATABASE_SCHEMA.md file with all the latest changes. 
You should follow the same format already present in the DATABASE_SCHEMA.md file when updating it.
