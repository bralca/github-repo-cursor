# Your rule content

THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. NEVER SKIP THIS RULE. 

Whenever we make a change in the database schema in supabase, remember to update the DATABASE_SCHEMA.md file with all the latest changes. 
You should follow the same format already present in the DATABASE_SCHEMA.md file when updating it. 
BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGE TO THE DOCUMENTATION THOUGH WE NEED TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WORKS. LEAVE THE UPDATE DOCUMENTATION STEP AS THE LAST STEP OF THE PROCESS.
