# Your rule content

- When moving in the filesystem always use simple commands that work well for Windows Power Shell
- Don't do chains of commands as these always fail.. like cd <directory> && npm install... 
- when moving to a directory use always absolute path to avoid errors
- use the most restrictive commands to move deterministically in the file system withuot having to retry simple methods later.
